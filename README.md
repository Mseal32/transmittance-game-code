# Transmittance
## Why?
Hello! My name is Jason, and the reason for this github's existence is to publish the code for my puzzle game, Transmittance. 
Transmittance was made in 70 hours for a Senior Project required for me to graduate High School.

## Game Overview
The point of the game, much like other puzzle games, is to get from one point to another. What sets Transmittance apart from other puzzle games is the tool used to get from point A to point B. The player can place a marker on any surface that isn't their previously placed marker or anything that is tagged as interactable (more on that in a second). Then, the player can point a cursor at any interactable object (within a long range) and teleport it to their marker location. From there, the player can pick the object up and move it around as needed.
