# transmittance-game-code
 
 Hello! My name is Jason, and the reason for this github's existence is to publish the game code for my puzzle game, Transmittance. The journey of making this game has been an arduous, yet exhilarating and exciting one. I would like to thank the developers that take the time out of their lives, especially Brackeys and Code Monkey (you can find them on YouTube), to educate programming nobodies like myself entirely for free!

 If you're interested in trying my first foray into programming and game dev as whole, check out the prototype (Version 0.1) at https://mseal.itch.io/transmittance?secret=aUUQJIxCyJbAjFuT7DAj0pZUUk
